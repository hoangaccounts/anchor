# North Star: Intent‑First AI Engineering

## Vision

The future of AI‑assisted engineering is **intent‑first**, not prompt‑first.

Humans declare meaning.
AI explores within constraints.
Infrastructure enforces the contract.

---

## The Problem

Current AI workflows rely on:
- Implicit intent
- Cooperative interpretation
- Trust in model behavior

This leads to drift, inconsistency, and unreviewable decisions.

---

## The Stack

### 1. Design Intent Kit (Methodology)

- Human‑readable
- Portable
- Works without special tooling
- Establishes the collaboration pattern

### 2. AICL (Infrastructure)

- Formalizes intent and constraints
- Enforces refusal and phase gating
- Makes workflows deterministic
- Eliminates reliance on “good prompting”

---

## End State

A developer can say:

“This project uses the Design Intent Kit workflow.”

And the AI system will:
- Know what phase it is in
- Know what is forbidden
- Refuse invalid actions
- Surface ambiguity explicitly

---

## Guiding Principles

- Intent over inference
- Constraints over cleverness
- Refusal over guesswork
- Infrastructure over vibes

---

## Why This Matters

As AI becomes more capable, control surfaces must become more explicit.

This approach treats AI as **infrastructure**, not conversation.
